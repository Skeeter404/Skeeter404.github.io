            <p>
                My name is Bronson Bird. I was born on March, 4 1996, in Salt Lake City, UT. I have lived in the Salt Lake Valley since I was born, however I was partially raised in the rural parts of South-West Wyoming.

                Being raised in both the city and the country definitely made me appreciate and enjoy different activities. I love spending time on my grandparents ranch, riding horses, taking care of the cattle, shooting guns (lots of shooting); but I also love spending time at home on my computer, playing video games, watching great videos, or, learning how to code.

                I started learning how to code halfway through the year 2018. This began when I realized that it seemed like something I would be interested in, and would hold my interest for years to come. From there, I enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp through the University of Utah, and continued my learning of coding and wev development.
